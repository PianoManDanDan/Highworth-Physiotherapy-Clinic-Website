		<h3>ANIMAL THERAPY</h3>

		<p>Yes, just like humans, animals can also benefit from physiotherapy when they are suffering from muscular skeletal problems following a road traffic accident, surgery or other injury. The basic make up of animals is very similar to humans and many of the techniques and equipment used is the same, although obviously when treating something as large as a horse there are differences!</p>
		<p>The most common animals treated are dogs, cats and horses, usually following surgery, road traffic accidents or after straining themselves whilst running about. However even cows have been sucessfully treated after they have injured themselves.</p>
		<p>There are around 300 physiotherapists in the UK who are ACPAT members (Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Animal Therapy) and are qualified to treat animals. Currently three of us at Highworth Physiotherapy Clinic are qualified to do so.</p>
		<p>Many animal insurance policies also include cover for physiotherapy treatment, although you should obviously check first.</p>
		<br>

		<h5>The Veterinary Surgeons Act of 1966</h5>
		<p>The Veterinary Surgeons act of 1966 states that only a veterinary surgeon or someone authorised by one can treat an animal. It is therefore illegal for a physiotherapist to treat an animal without prior consent from a vet. Most of the vets in this area know us and are more than happy to refer your pet to us if they believe physiotherapy is the appropriate course of treatment.</p>

		<h5>Equine Health Checklists</h5>
		<p>Below are some guidelines issued by BEVA for an equine health checklist. These were issued as of recent biosecurity alerts.</p>

		<h5>Suprising Fact</h5>
		<img alt="Giraffe" src="giraffe.jpg"> <!-- <img style="float: left; width: 96px; height: 125px;" alt="giraffe" src="giraffe.jpg" hspace="8"> -->
		<p>Giraffes have the same number of bones in their necks as humans. The bones (cervical vertebrae) can be over 25cm long resulting in their much longer necks. If they had more bones and joints the neck would be unstable without more muscles and they wouldn't be able to hold it upright. In fact almost all mammals have 7 cervical vertebrae and only a small number, including a sloth and manatee do not.</p>
