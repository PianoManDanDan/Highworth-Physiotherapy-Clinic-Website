        <h1>PHYSIOTHERAPY</h1>
        <p>
          Physiotherapy is the treatment of a wide variety of injuries and conditions using a range of manual
          techniques, manipulation, massage, advice, exercise and electrotherapy. When appropriate, a lot of time is
          spent teaching the patient self help exercises so that they can manage their own condition. All the
          physiotherapists at this practice are experienced Chartered Physiotherapists who treat sports injuries, back
          pain, neck pain, arthritis, aches, strains and pains. We are committed to a high level of clinical expertise
          and customer satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          All our physiotherapists undertake at least 25 hours post graduate education every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          After qualification many physiotherapists go on to train in specialist areas including acupuncture, pilates
          and animal therapy. As we have several physiotherapists at the clinic, with a range of different specialisms,
          we may transfer you to a different physiotherapist within the clinic whose skills, we believe, will more
          successfully treat your condition.

        <h2>Common problems treated by Physiotherapists</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Tennis Elbow</h3>
            <p>
              A common term used to describe pains in the forearm and elbow area. However this condition is not
              restricted to tennis players but can affect golfers, gardeners and factory workers who strain their arm.
              The condition can be treated with manual therapy, ultrasound and often the use of an arm brace can help
              prevent the condition returning.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Upper and lower back pain</h3>
            <p>
              These can have a variety of causes from poor posture to whiplash and even uneven leg length. Most can be
              successfully treated with a combination of manual therapy, advice, postural correction and exercises.
              Lumbar rolls, seat wedges and neck pillows can also help maintain improvement as can workplace
              assessments.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Headaches</h3>
            <p>
              Headaches are often caused by problems in the top part of the neck at the base of the skull. Headaches
              with this cause can therefore be treated as a neck problem and do respond well to manual therapy and
              exercises.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Strains</h3>
            <p>
              Muscle and ligament strains are very common and not just in sports men and women. They can be extremely
              painful and debilitating but fortunately do respond very well to electrotherapy such as ultrasound or
              laser treatment. Graded exercises and advice on how quickly to return to your normal activity are also
              very important.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Arthritis</h3>
            <p>
              Although the actual arthritis cannot be treated by physiotherapy, the pain, swelling and muscle weakness
              can. Physiotherapy can therefore make life much more comfortable and even delay or prevent the need for
              surgery.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Sports injuries</h3>
            <p>
              Often injuries occur during training and whilst rest would be the first choice treatment upcoming events
              e.g. a marathon or a football tournament don't allow this. Physiotherapy can speed up the healing process
              and specific training advice will ensure training can continue without causing further injury. RICE is
              the recognised first intervention, meaning rest, ice, compression and elevation. Physiotherapists are
              experts in the initial treatment and follow up rehabilitation of these types of injuries.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Homeopathy</h2>
        <p>
          Homeopathy is a safe, complementary medicine suitable for all ages. It can be used to treat stress and
          anxiety, migraines, eczema, childhood illness and behaviour problems.
        </p>

        <h2>Steroid Injection Therapy</h2>
        <h3>Why would I need a local steroid injection?</h3>
        <p>
          Steroid Injections can be given to treat inflammation or pain. They are usually injected into the joint of
          the surrounding soft tissue. Sometimes they are used alone, other times they will be followed by
          physiotherapy. Reducing pain and swelling with a steroid injection can help make the physiotherapy work
          better. The steroid injection is usually combined with local anaesthetic. Local anaesthetic is used to
          increase the volume of the injection and help us know that the injection is in the right place.
        </p>
        <h3>How long will the steroid injection take to work, and how long will it last?</h3>
        <p>
          This varies between different people, but usually improvement starts after one or two days. Sometimes it can
          take up to 6 weeks for the benefits to take effect. The benefit usually lasts from a few weeks to several
          months.
        </p>
        <h3>Do I need to do anything after the injection?</h3>
        <p>
          After the injection it is advisable to rest the injected limb for the first 3 to 7 days. Try to avoid
          activities that make the symptoms worse. Limit walking and don't participate in sports.
        </p>

        <h2>Orthotics</h2>
        <p>
          Excessive pronation of the foot (flat feet) causes the arch of the foot to flatten and can result in heel,
          knee, hip and back pain. It is very common and in most cases can be treated by a physiotherapist with
          supportive insoles. The insoles support the arch, realigning the lower limb correctly which alleviates the
          resulting pain. Incorrect foot posture and leg length discrepancies can also be corrected with appropriately
          positioned additional wedges. For more complicated conditions we can refer you to a specialist podiatrist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sequence of pictures below show: 1. Normal foot; 2. Flat foot with collapsed arch; 3. Over arched foot;
          4. Patient with excess pronation commonly known as flat feet.
